For running this project: include the sqlite jar in the client, and change the connection paramters of RMI if needed.


ClientMain.jar opens 2 instances of the application and ClientMainJar.jar opens one (this is the one that you want to package in a jar or somehting like that)

To start the server just run ServerMain.java
